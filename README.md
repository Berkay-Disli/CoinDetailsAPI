# CoinsAPI
Coin showcase app that executes URLSession tasks to get data from API service.
This app demonstrates how to easily show a JSON list to user. 
The API service provides hundreds of coin info. User only sees coins from rank 1 to 20, therefore an overwhelming UI is prevented.
User can also filter the coins by using the search box. 
In addition to that, a small popup view is presented when a coin from the list is clicked.



## Architecture
- SwiftUI and MVVM
- URLSession, DataTask Requests Inside ViewModel
- Sorting, Filtering and Managing **JSON Data** Inside ViewModel
- Popup View Using ZStack
- Animations
- Smoothly Delivered Transitions
